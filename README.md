This is an attempt to automate automatization of testing

Original idea was proposed in optdyn/qa#61

### Installation and Configuration

It is recommended to create a separate user in a system to run this tool. Also, a separate github user

1. Configure your git application and setup your SSH key


### Implementation plan

1. Implement configuration âœ“
2. Implement repository read: clone/pull
3. Implement recursive reader for files in repository
4. Implement code analyzer to find test tags
5. Implement wiki page generator
6. Implement repository push for wiki
7. Implement reader of issues from repository file
8. Implement automatic issue creation
9. Implement issue updater
10. Implement GitHub webhook for repository update events
